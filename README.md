# SimpleEthereumSlot
A simple slot machine in Python working on a local Ethereum blockchain using Web3 library.\ 
We love slots, we love blockchain.

# How to use
You need Ganache in order to have your own local blockchain. You can download it by clicking [this link](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).\
Note that ganache-cli works fine for this purpose too.\
You might need to modify the line ```233``` to use your local blockchain RPC server (http://127.0.0.1:7545 by default).\

You also need the Web3 Python library, install it via pip.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
